# Settings and project overrides

The "Applying settings for …" sentence at the top of Settings pages picks the project a change
applies to. Pages that only hold app preferences, such as Appearance, don't show it. They start at
**All projects** and stay selected as you move between categories or search for a setting.

Preferences saved in this app, such as appearance, confirmations and browser profiles, always
show and ignore the selection. Everything else is stored by the local server and applies to every
project unless a project overrides it.

Choose a project to override settings for it. A layers icon beside each row's title shows where
the value comes from: the built-in default, the environment, or a project override. Click it to
see that chain. An override can be reset to inherit again. Settings that cannot be overridden by a
project are shown read-only while a project is selected.

Changing an environment value never touches a project's own override. When projects override the
setting you are editing, the layers icon counts them and the chain lists each one with its value:
click a project to jump to it, or **Reset all** to make those projects follow the environment
again.

## Worktree branch names

In **Settings → Source Control → Worktree branch naming**, choose a static prefix,
a model-selected semantic prefix such as `feat/` or `fix/`, or custom instructions
for the complete name. The static prefix defaults to `t3/`; a trailing slash is
optional, and an empty prefix adds nothing. Invalid characters in a static prefix
are replaced with hyphens. Custom instructions are appended to
the naming prompt and can specify issue IDs, namespaces, and casing.

These settings apply to automatically named new worktree branches. Select a project
to override its environment defaults. Worktree directories keep their original names.
If generation fails, or a custom name is invalid or already taken, the temporary
branch name remains.

## Defaults and inheritance

General contains the model and workspace for new threads. Integrations controls agent browser
access. Source Control contains automatic pull, the default pull request merge method and text
generation. The same rows edit environment defaults or project overrides depending on the
project crumb.

The Project category, shown while a project is selected, holds the project's name, icon, actions,
checkouts and removal. Actions belong to a project: editing them creates the project's own list,
and reset returns to the environment's shared list. A project's
`t3.json` actions can be imported there.

Settings a repository can also declare in `t3.json`, such as the workspace for new threads,
resolve in one order: a project override, then the environment setting, then `t3.json`, then the
built-in default. Leave a setting on **Inherit** to let the next tier decide.
Browser access changes apply when an agent session next starts.

New worktrees initialize git submodules recursively. If that step is slow because the repository
declares many nested submodules, set **Submodules** in **Settings → General** (with the project
selected to override it there) to **Top level only** to stop at the ones the repository declares
itself, or **Skip** to leave them for a setup script. It resolves in the same order as the
workspace default: a `"worktreeSubmodules"` value in the `t3.json` of the branch being checked out
applies when the project and environment are both on **Inherit**.

## Retry workspace preparation

If fetching, checking out a worktree, or a blocking setup action fails, fix the cause and choose
**Retry** on the failed preparation in the thread. T3 Code retries the original preparation and
starts the waiting agent when it succeeds. An already-created worktree is reused.

## Worktree location

New worktrees go in the `worktrees` folder of the T3 home directory. To put them somewhere else,
such as another drive, set **Settings → Storage → Worktree location** to an absolute path like
`D:\worktrees` or `~/worktrees`. The setting is per machine. Existing worktrees stay where they
are, and cleanup covers both the default folder and the custom one.

## Storage cleanup

Open **Settings → Storage** to enable automatic cleanup on this machine. Policies are off by
default and run while T3 Code is running: at startup, when changed, and hourly.

Select a project to set **Automatic worktree cleanup** to **Inherit**, **Off**, or **Custom**.
Inherit follows this machine's rules; Off keeps that project's worktrees until you remove them
manually. Custom applies separate worktree rules to the selected project or checkout. Browser
captures and log retention remain machine-wide.

Worktrees can be removed after a chosen number of inactive days, after merging, or when they
have no commits beyond the default branch. Only T3-managed worktrees are eligible. Active
sessions and shared worktrees prevent removal. **Keep worktrees with local changes** defaults
to **Uncommitted changes**, which protects tracked edits and untracked files but deletes ignored
files such as `.env` and build output. **Any local files** also protects ignored files other than
`node_modules`. **Edited tracked files** protects only tracked edits and allows untracked and
ignored files to be deleted. Branches and thread history stay; starting another turn recreates the checkout.
Merge cleanup requires a merged pull request whose commits are included in the remote default
branch. A squash or rebase merge on GitHub also counts when the pull request targeted the default
branch and the worktree is still at the pull request's last commit.

Enable **Delete worktrees with deleted threads** to remove safe worktrees after their last
thread is deleted, including archived threads and worktrees left by earlier deletions. The
server waits for sessions and terminals to stop and retries skipped worktrees after restart.
Existing prompts for deleting a worktree manually remain available when this policy is off.

Choose **Delete now** to run the enabled rules immediately. The latest results show which
worktrees were removed or kept and why, plus any failures.

Browser captures and rotated logs have separate retention periods. Expired capture links stop
working. Current logs, message attachments, and browser profiles are kept.

## Project icons

Select the project and open Project to choose an icon, emoji, monogram, or image. The choice applies to
every checkout in the project group and appears on connected clients. Choose **Automatic** to let
T3 Code detect an icon again.

Choose **Monogram** in the icon picker to set one or two letters or numbers and a color.

When no image is found, the app shows a two-character monogram with a color
from the icon palette, derived from the saved project name. For example, `Nebula` becomes `NA`,
`Silver Orchard` becomes `SO`, and `M7 Forge` becomes `M7`.

## Keep the default branch current

In Source Control, enable **Automatically pull** to keep the default-branch checkout up to date
with its configured upstream. Choose an environment to set the default or a project to override it.

T3 Code only pulls when it can fast-forward and the checkout has no changed files, untracked files,
or local commits. It skips checkouts on another branch or without an upstream. If a checkout has
local work, resolve it yourself before automatic pulls can resume.
